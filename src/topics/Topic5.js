        "Hello World!" is a reference to the most popular line of code in the
        world. Lets take a look.

        <br>
        </br>

        Open your editor (we will use VS code), and save to your desktop (for ease of access),
        and name the program HelloWorld.py.
      </p>

      <p>Once you have it ready, type "print('HelloWorld')"</p>

      <p> This will print to the console and you have successfully wrote and ran
        your first line of code!
      </p>
    </div>
